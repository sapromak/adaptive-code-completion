\chapter{Long Context}\label{chap:long-context}

The following topics will be covered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The significance of long context for in-context learning,
    \item An overview of the challenges associated with long context, such as the quadratic dependency of computational resources on context length, the inability of RoPE to extrapolate, and the noise generated by softmax-based attention,
    \item Strategies for addressing long context challenges, including memory-efficient attention implementations, key-value (KV) caching, gradient checkpointing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), subquadratic attention, and context extension methods.
\end{itemize}
