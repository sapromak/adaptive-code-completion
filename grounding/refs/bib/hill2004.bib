  abstract  = {Modern software development environments include tools to help programmers write code efficiently and accurately. For example many integrated development environments include variable name completion, method name completion and recently refactoring tools have been added to some environments. This paper extends the idea of automatic completion to include completion of the body of a method by employing machine learning algorithms on the near duplicate code segments that frequently exist in large software projects.},
